        "This question is a BFS (breadth-first search) algorithm problem. The difficulty of this is in going from a list to a tree and keeping track of the values. Ashish solved this by first iterating the list one value at a time and contstructing the tree along the way (root -> left -> right) in the list_to_tree() function. Then the second fuction find_closest_duplicate() takes the tree and pop the leftmost element from the deque and then add the neighbors of the popped element to the right end of the deque, if it is not a duplicate value. Duplicate values are cleverly handled by the dictionary duplicates{}. As soon as a value from node (node.val) matches with duplicates{} it returns the value. Since this function traverse from the root, this avoids keeping track of the height of the tree as the first duplicate must be closest to the root."

From my perspective, it seems difficult to make dramatic improvement to the solution. In terms of area of improvement, I think it is not necessary to keep track of 'distance' in find_closest_duplicate() as distance was not necessary when iterating from root node. Also, I am uncertain why a fourth function is_symmetric() is necssary and can perhaps be be integrated with find_closest_duplicate() for simplicity and cleaner code."

It seems that it could be possible to implement a recurrsive approach, but given the limited time, I used a more naive approach by first finding min max value from the given range and traverse through the numbers. The biggest time compexity contributor is the sorting step. Since the numbers must be in order, it seems impossible to avoid this step. From my research sorting problem is quite inefficient so I would love to learn if there is a better way to handle it.
